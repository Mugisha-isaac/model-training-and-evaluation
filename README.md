## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes demographic, educational, and socioeconomic factors to predict whether individuals in East African countries have access to cellphones - a key indicator of digital readiness and economic participation in modern East African societies.

### Problem Statement

Predicting digital readiness among East African populations is crucial for:
- Targeted digital literacy programs
- Financial inclusion initiatives
- Mobile banking expansion strategies
- Educational technology deployment
- Government digital services accessibility
- Bridging the digital divide

### Social Impact

Understanding digital readiness patterns helps policymakers and NGOs design effective interventions to increase technology adoption in underserved communities, promoting economic development and social inclusion.

## 🔍 Data Description

The dataset contains demographic and socioeconomic information about individuals in East African countries, with the target variable being `cellphone_access` (whether an individual has access to a cellphone).

### Data Source
Data is sourced from: [East-Africa-Digital-Readness-prediction GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Mugisha-isaac/East-Africa-Digital-Readness-prediction)
