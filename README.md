## Project Overview

This project analyzes demographic, educational, and socioeconomic factors to identify potential young talents in East Africa who have digital access (cellphones) - a key requirement for showcasing their talents (music, arts, etc.) on our online platform and connecting them with potential sponsors.

### Problem Statement

Identifying digitally-ready young talents in East Africa is crucial for:
- Building an inclusive talent discovery platform
- Connecting talented youth with potential sponsors
- Creating opportunities for artistic development
- Supporting cultural and creative industries
- Fostering economic empowerment through talent development
- Bridging the talent discovery gap in Africa

### Social Impact

Identifying digitally-ready young individuals helps our platform connect talented youth with sponsors who can nurture their artistic development, leading to economic opportunities, cultural preservation, and global recognition for African creative talents.

## Data Description

The dataset contains demographic and socioeconomic information about individuals in East African countries, with the target variable being `cellphone_access` (whether an individual has access to a cellphone) - a critical requirement for using our talent platform.

## Methodology

The project compares traditional machine learning algorithms with deep learning models to identify young individuals with digital access who could potentially showcase their talents on our platform and connect with sponsors.

### Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

### Deep Learning Models
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks
- Deep Neural Networks with various architectures
- Feature embedding techniques

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

## Project Structure

1. **Setup and Installation**: Libraries and dependencies
2. **Data Loading**: Loading and initial inspection of the dataset
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing distributions and relationships
4. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaning and transforming data
